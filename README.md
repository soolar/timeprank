# Timeprank Generator
## What is this?
I had been using this time prank message on a bunch of my friends that I came up with which I based
on old chain e-mails. But I decided that I didn't want to just copy/paste the same message at them
day after day, so instead I elected to write a procedural terrible chain-email time prank generator.
At first I was planning to keep it to myself, so that the world at large would not be exposed to the
horrors these hands have wrought, but I changed my mind pretty quickly.

Look upon my works, ye might, and despair.

## How to install
Simply type `svn checkout https://github.com/soolar/timeprank/trunk/` in KoLMafia's gCLI.

## How to use
Type `timeprank <playername>` in the gCLI to generate a time prank and send it to that person. If you
just want to generate a time prank without sending one to anyone, just type `timeprank` in the gCLI.

## What is yet to come
* More formats for messages, there's only one atm
* More, more and mooooore word buckets, and words in them
* MASSIVELY improved procedural misspelling tech
* Maybe some other nonsense, who knows
