message	#{EXCLAMATION} #{EXCLAMATION}#{!}#{!} If you forward this message within #{1=number+timeunit:plural}, the #{adjective@positive} #{adjective@positive} #{character} will #{verb@positive} you with #{adjective@positive} times for like, the rest of your #{adjective@positive} life#{?}#{!} But if you don't forward it within #{1}, the #{adjective@negative} #{adjective@negative} #{character} will #{verb@negative} you with #{adjective@negative} times for the entire rest of your whole  #{adjective@negative} life instead.

Even in this #{9=adjective} fever, I can't #{10=verb}. I'll accept the #{11=noun@abstract,positive} to dive in; it's about to #{12=verb}#{!} Without a #{noun@abstract}, without a #{noun@abstract}, Our #{noun} changes silently. At the thought of the coming #{timeunit}, my #{bodypart}beat quickens. When you feel #{adjective@negative}, I'll come running right away, wanting to #{verb} you #{adverb}, Wherever you are, no matter where, I'll Fly High! Hurry up. Before I knew it, my #{adjective} #{noun@abstract} grew too #{adjective} to contain. It's #{adjective@negative} to never do more than dream of it, I want you to be mine! I don't want to be #{verb:past} by your #{adjective} #{bodypart}. Accept all my #{noun@abstract} for you as it is, #{exclamation}#{!} Ring out#{!} Shall I name this #{2} "#{3} Halation"#{?} I can't wait for our #{4} to #{5}; it's frustrating, but it's a pure-#{6}ed #{7} called #{8}.
